Summary Holdings Transactions Your Account About NSDL

Dear Investor,

Greetings from NSDL.

We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your

investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,

securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in

this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.

NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was

articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this

Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.

As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance

policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (elA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have elA,

please visit https:/Awww.nir.ndml.in/ to open elA online. We are now introducing additional feature of Portfolio Value Trend whereby

you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new

fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL

demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information

pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.

| am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment

portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy

to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit

https://nsdicas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.

Yours Sincerely,

G. V. Nageswara Rao

Portfolio Value Trend

Monthly movement of your Consolidated Portfolio Value since December 2018 is given below. It reflects the monthly change in your total wealth invested in the assets which

are consolidated in NSDL CAS. Increase in your portfolio value may be due to appreciation of your investments and also fresh investments. Similarly, decrease in portfolio

value may be due to depreciation in investments or sale of investments.

1. Annualised Return (%) indicates the return on investment in the mutual fund scheme since April 1, 2015 or the date of your investment, whichever is later. It is

computed using XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) method and takes into account NAV appreciation as well as dividend.

2. Annualised Return (%) has not been computed where details provided to NSDL by mutual funds are not adequate, where the investment has been held for less

than a month or where the holdings have become zero.
